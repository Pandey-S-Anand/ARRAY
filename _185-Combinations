/*
If given an array of size 'n' and a value 'k', and asked to find all possible combinations of size 
'k', we need to determine all possible ways to choose 'k' elements from the 'n' elements. Here, the order does not matter. 
Thus, if two containers contain the same elements in different orders, they form only one combination.

 * Two matrices can be multiplied if and only if the number of columns 
 * in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.
 * 
 * Let the matrices be:
 * Matrix A with dimensions m × n: m rows and n columns.
 * Matrix B with dimensions p × q: p rows and q columns.
 * 
 * Resultant Matrix:
 * If Matrix A (of size m × n) is multiplied with B (of size p × q) 
 * (where n = p), the resulting matrix C = A × B will have dimensions 
 * m × q (i.e., m rows and q columns).
 * 
 * The total number of multiplication operations required will be: m * n (or p) * q

 * Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM) Problem:
 * In MCM, our aim is to minimize the total multiplication operations.
 * 
 * Given matrices:
 * A (10 × 30), B (30 × 5), and C (5 × 60), the goal is to find the 
 * optimal order of multiplication to minimize the total number of multiplication operations. 
 * 
 * Case 1: Multiply (A × B) first, then multiply the result with C:
 *    - Step 1: Multiply A (10 × 30) and B (30 × 5):
 *      Multiplication operations = 10 × 30 × 5 = 1500 multiplication operations.
 *      Resultant matrix dimensions = 10 × 5.
 *    - Step 2: Multiply the resultant matrix (10 × 5) with C (5 × 60):
 *      Multiplication operations = 10 × 5 × 60 = 3000 multiplication operations.
 *    - Total multiplication operations = 1500 + 3000 = 4500 multiplication operations.
 * 
 * Case 2: Multiply (B × C) first, then multiply the result with A:
 *    - Step 1: Multiply B (30 × 5) and C (5 × 60):
 *      Multiplication operations = 30 × 5 × 60 = 9000 multiplication operations.
 *      Resultant matrix dimensions = 30 × 60.
 *    - Step 2: Multiply the resultant matrix (30 × 60) with A (10 × 30):
 *      Multiplication operations = 10 × 30 × 60 = 18000 multiplication operations.
 *    - Total multiplication operations = 9000 + 18000 = 27000 multiplication operations.
 * 
 * Multiplication Operations Summary:
 * 1. Order: (A × B) × C → Total Multiplication Operations = 4500.
 * 2. Order: A × (B × C) → Total Multiplication Operations = 27000.
 * 
 * Conclusion:
 * For the given matrices, the optimal order of multiplication is:
 * (A × B) × C, which requires 4500 multiplication operations, as it minimizes the total multiplication operations.

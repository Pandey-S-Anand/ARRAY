/*
 * The LIS (Longest Increasing Subsequence) of an array represents the longest subsequence 
 * of elements that are already in increasing order. Each step allows us to remove an element 
 * and insert it into a different position to achieve a fully sorted array.
 * 
 * To minimize the number of steps, we should move the fewest elements possible. 
 * Since the LIS is the longest subsequence that maintains relative order, it ensures 
 * the least number of elements need to be moved. Using the LIS guarantees the minimum 
 * number of steps required to sort the array.
 * 
 * If the length of the array is N and the length of the LIS is L, then the minimum number 
 * of steps needed to sort the array is:
 * 
 * Steps = N - L
